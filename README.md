# FLOPPA (Flasher Operation)
This repository is a driver for point to point LoRa communication with microcontroller devices in the field. It's initial use case is to communicate with and control a Xenon calibration flasher for the Telescope Array experiment in the west desert of Utah. It is a wrapper of drivers for sx127x type LORA modules and the sd1306 lcd display in the Heltec Wifi Lora 32 (V2) written by LeMaRiva.
